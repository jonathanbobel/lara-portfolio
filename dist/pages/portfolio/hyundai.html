      <h1>Service Consultant Guide</h1>
      <p>
        Tire Guide was a lengthy project targeting Service Consultants to give
        them a breakdown of what their tire program offered. The was sent out
        nation-wide to over 500 consultants. The content was Hyundai specific.
        The final piece was wire bound, with laminated tabs for each section. I
        organized all photo shoots or retouching with our in-house photographer.
        After it was sent out, it was such a successful document Hyundai asked
        us to create a PDF version to have digitally available.
