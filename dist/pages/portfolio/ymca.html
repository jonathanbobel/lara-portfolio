      <h1>YMCA Membership Campaign</h1>
      <p>
        With the YMCA of the USA updating their brand, they need a new
        membership campaign. There were a total of three concepts produced for
        the campaign. Each concept consisted of a poster, direct mail post-card,
        and a local ad that could be placed in local newspapers.

        Working with
        <a href="https://www.keithberr.com/" target="_blank"
          >Keith Berr Productions </a
        >, this campaign resulted in a five day photoshoot over 10,000 images. I
        was able to lead, direct, and organize over 20 different models.
