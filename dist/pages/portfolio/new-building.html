	        <h1>Dealer Tire's Move-In Kit</h1>
	        <p>Working closely with HR and communications around our building move, we decided to create a Move-In Kit. It included a calendar, notebook, and parking pass. The calendar had information about moving out of our old building and moving into our new one. After the move happened the calendar had a full functioning 2017 desk calendar. GRIT is a term that DT uses to describe itself and associates. We get down to business and do what's needed. Being able to bring GRIT to life in a small yet visible instance was important. The parking pass, while small, was a fun and challenging opportunity to breath life into Dealer Tire's brand.</p>
