The client had out-of-date collateral and they needed to update some of their materials. My original idea was to have a photo shoot at a local restaurant. This would allow the client to get a great image, while targeting their audience. I worked with the account executive to have the client come in and tour a local restaurant. Both the client and restaurant agreed to my concept. Not only was the photo shoot successful but I also directed the interior illustration with our in-house illustrator. }
