2016 Dealer Tire Annual Report\
Each year I am tasked with developing a theme and designing the annual report. This was the first year utilizing the new brand. Working closely with my copywriter, we met with each department, discussed achievements, challenges, and future objectives and put together a cohesive report. The cover utilized two sheets of 100# cover with a die cut, white ink, and a UV varnish to hint at \'93Let\'92s Go.\'94 The binding was fun and flowed throughout the piece. The back cover was 100# duplex and folded to allow for extra support. Two small die cuts were added to allow for the financial insert.}
