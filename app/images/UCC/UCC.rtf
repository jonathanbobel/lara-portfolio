United Church of Christ Insurance Board\
The UCC Insurance Board requested four messages that needed to be communicated to all their members. My solution was 11 x 17 inch posters that could be easily printed internally or at a local print shop. The client wanted specific scenes and with a very small budget I realized a photo shoot was out of the question. My solution was to create illustrations of those specific scenes. This gave me the freedom to change what I needed. The use of no specific facial features was intentional. I wanted the audience to be able to place themselves or a loved one in the poster.}
