      <h1>Hello, I’m Lara.</h1>
      <p>
        I’m currently looking for a full-time Art Director role, but don’t let
        that stop you for a quick conversation on any other services I offer.
        Efficient and deadline driven, I can exceed any project expectation.
      </p>
      <p>Previous creative experiences include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Dealer Tire: 2011 – 2020</li>
        <li>Antidote Functional Therapies: 2017 – 2019</li>
        <li>The Adcom Group: 2004 – 2019</li>
        <li>Bisig Impact Group: Summer 2003</li>
        <li>BFA from Kent State University – Visual Communication Design</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        When I’m not flexing my creative muscle I have a lot of hobbies and
        interests. Backpacking + camping, OrangeTheory, riding my scooter or
        bicycle, snuggling with my pets, roller-skating, cross-stitching, +
        journaling. Recently started birding, which makes all outdoor activities
        more fun. This is just the beginning. I haven’t even mentioned my
        affinity for CLE sports, exploring local breweries, and all the
        traveling I enjoy doing.
