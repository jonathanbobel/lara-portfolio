      <h1>2019 Jaguar/Land Rover Dealer Conference</h1>
      <p>
        Create a B2B and B2C booth for the Jaguar/Land Rover Annual Conference
        with a tire centric message that was clear and concise. Both events took
        place in Coachella, CA and the creative direction I took utilized the
        latitude/longitude coordinates. I initiated design layouts for the B2C
        booth while waiting for approval on the B2B booth. I collaborated with
        the copywriter and stakeholders to make sure the messaging and design
        complimented each other and worked within JLRs brand.
      </p>
      <p>
        The B2B booth was successful due to the number of visitors and email
        signups. Because of my initiative with the B2C booth we gained approval
        and Goodyear agreed to partner with us giving way to the funding needed.
