        A new business needed brand identity, website, and online presence. I
        interviewed the owner and listened to her vision of her ideal brand and
        we coordinated the brand launch with graduation. Business cards and
        social media assets were first, then the
        <a href="http://antidote-therapies.com/" target="_blank">website</a>
        followed. I taught myself Sketch to present to the client with the added
        benefit of assisting the web developer. Final product was a solid online
        presence that allowed her to expand clientele and hire another associate
        to round out her business.
