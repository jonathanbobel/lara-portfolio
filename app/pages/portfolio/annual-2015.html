      <h1>2015 Dealer Tire Annual Report</h1>
      <p>
        This was the last annual report I designed that didn't have to follow a
        Dealer Tire brand – since it didn’t exist yet. Working closely with my
        copywriter and photographer I was able to highlight each department with
        a colorful photo representing them. Each department included the
        Partner, a quote, an overview, challenges, accomplishments, and main
        objective.
      </p>
      <p>
        Depending on key accomplishments, each department had the ability to
        include metrics specific to their goals. Keeping a similar flow helped
        each department supply quality information that we were able to mold
        into a progressive story for the year.
