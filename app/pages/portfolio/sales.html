      <h1>Tire Sales Analysis</h1>
      <p>
        Working closely with the VP of Sales and our copywriter, I proposed and
        designed this poster-like piece as a solution for the sales department
        to use as a communication tool highlighting the effectiveness of the
        tire program. The size makes a big impact once opened and when folded
        down it is easy for the sales associates to carry while on the road.
